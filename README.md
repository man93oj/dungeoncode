# dungeoncode
Web based game that teaches kids to code. This project is our solution to the JP Morgan Chase challenge to create a web app for social good. 

## Getting Started

There are two ways to access this project.
* You can open the top-level index.html file in a browser to view the web site locally. You will still need an internet connection since Trinket is web based.
* Open the website at https://stroshinator.github.io/dungeoncode

### Prerequisites

* Updated web browser
* Internet Connection
* Code editor
* Java IDE in case you want to edit the Java source code for the game


## Running the game

* Go to https://stroshinator.github.io/dungeoncode which is the homepage
* Select level you want to start at, we suggest level 1
* Follow the instructions to the right and in the shell, we suggest to play this game competitively with two people
* After completing a level, click the "Go to next level" button, or click "Home" button and select the next level


## Built With

* [HTML/CSS Bootstrap Templates](https://startbootstrap.com/) - The template used to create the skeleton of the web site
* [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) - Used to embed an interactive shell into our website to play the game
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Used to create repository of code and deploy website
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - Java was the main language used for programming the game logic
